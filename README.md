# Crystal Collector

### About / How to Use
The goal of Crystal Collector is to match the target score.  Each crystal will be assigned a random number, and once a crystal is clicked, that number will be added to the user's score.  If the user can match the target score, they win.  If the user goes above the target score, they lose.

### Functionality
* The target score is a random number between 19-120
* Each crystal will be assigned a random number between 1-12
* The javascript logic then checks to see if your score matches the target score, or if your score is greater than the target score
* If you match the score, you win, if your score is greater than the target, you lose

### Running Locally
Clone the project to your computer, right click, and open in default browser.  Then go ahead and see if you can match the target score!
